### Project Overview

This data analysis project focuses on uncovering key insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By examining various aspects of the sales data, the project aims to identify trends, provide actionable recommendations, and enhance understanding of the companyâ€™s performance. The insights derived will help guide strategic decision-making and optimize future sales strategies.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The main dataset for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, which includes comprehensive details about each transaction conducted by the company. This dataset serves as the foundation for identifying patterns, trends, and key performance indicators to drive actionable insights.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports
 
### Data Cleaning/Preparation

During the initial data preparation phase, we completed the following steps:

1. Loaded and inspected the dataset.
2. Addressed missing values.
3. Cleaned and formatted the data for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on examining the sales data to address key questions, including:

- What is the overall trend in sales?
- Which products are the best performers?
- When are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results

The analysis revealed the following insights:

1. The company's sales have shown consistent growth over the past year, with a significant surge during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A emerged as the top performer in both sales volume and revenue.
3. Marketing efforts should prioritize customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) to maximize returns.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we suggest the following actions:

- Increase marketing and promotional efforts during peak sales periods to optimize revenue.
- Prioritize the growth and promotion of products within Category A.
- Develop a customer segmentation strategy to effectively engage and retain high-LTV customers.

### Limitations

I removed all zero values from the budget and revenue columns to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. While a few outliers remain, the data still reveals a positive correlation between both the budget and the number of votes with revenue.
